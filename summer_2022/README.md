<a href="https://datascience.berkeley.edu/blog/python-data-science/">Python is a free, a general-purpose, and portable programming language. It is easy to use with its simple syntax and readability, which makes the code easy to understand and maintain.</a> 
Python can be extended via libraries that can be used to tackle problems in machine learning, data analysis, and beyond. It has a vast ecosystem and a dynamic user's community that make Python accessible to everyone.

The focus of this course will be on Data Science.
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Wikipedia</a>, **Data Science** is a `concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods` in order to `understand and analyze actual phenomena` with large volumes of data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science.
It aims to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make decisions based on the data.

Because of its features, Python is one of the preferred programming languages that data scientists can use to explore and analyze their datasets.
The <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/">growth of Python in Data Science</a> has gone hand in hand with that of its Pandas library, which opened the use of Python for data analysis to a broader audience by enabling it to deal with row-and-column datasets, import CSV files, and much more.

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of the Python programming language. In addition, it presents Python packages (Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas) used for data manipulation and visualization. The basics of Python combined with the Data Science topics, provide the necessary foundations for Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.


The instructors are:

- Carlos Cruz (Carlos.A.Cruz@nasa.gov)
- Bruce Van Aartsen (Bruce.VanAartsen@nasa.gov)
- Jules Kouatchou (Jules.Kouatchou@nasa.gov)

## <span style="color: red">Objectives</span>

This course series is divided in two sessions: 
- **Introductions to Python**: Meant for interns who are familiar with basic computer programming, but are new in Python.
- **Python for Data Science**: Meant for interns who have Python knowledge and plan to work on a project involving Data Science.

In the Introduction to Python, you will learn:

- Python basic syntax, variables, and types
- Conditional statements and loops
- Data structures: list, tuple, dictionary, set
- Functions and modules
- I/O with text files
- Scripting and packaging

At the end of the Introduction to Python sessions, learners will be able to write 
a basic Python application using functions and modules.  

<P>
<P>

In the Python for Data Science, the following will be covered:

- Numpy arrays
- Basic visualization with Matplotlib
- Web scraping
- Data manipulation (reading data file, performing statistical analysis, visualization, handling time series data) with Pandas

Those with some knowledge of Python when they start the Python for Data Science session,
will be able to write their own Python scripts to access web resources, read remote text files or tables, 
perform data wrangling, carry out basic data analytics and visualize data.

#### Which Session to Select?

If you have never been exposed to Python, you need to take this Introduction to Python course. 
In case you did some Python programming in the past and you want to assess your Python knowledge, take the following test (in less that 15 minutes and without using any help):

<div align="center">
<a href="https://forms.gle/mGQt4nFDLa5fHU5q9" target="_blank">Python Assessment Test</a>
</div>

<P>
<P>

**<span style="color: red">Make sure that you take this placement test (only once) by June 16 before you are 
allowed to take any Python sessions.</span>** 
If you have any issue with the test, please contact Jules (Jules.Kouatchou@nasa.gov).

If you score at least 80% then only take the **Scripting and Packaging** topic. 
Otherwise, take all the classes in the Introduction to Python session.

**The first course will be on Thursday, June 16 and the remaining ones will take place on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays (from June 22 to July 6). All of them will be from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm (US EDT).**

## <span style="color: red">Teaching Platform</span>

To take any of the two sessions, you are expected to:

- Have a gmail account (needed to have access to Google Colaboratory). Everything will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
- Have a  [Github](https://github.com/) account. Github is a web-based collaborative
  tool to discover, share and build software. You might need to share what you do with your mentor. 



Most of the classes will use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/). 
You are required to have a gmail account.
<p>
</p>
However, the classes on Thursday, June 16 and  Monday, June 27 will take place on the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) Science Data Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE). 
The access to SMCE <a href="https://astg.mysmce.com">https://astg.mysmce.com</a> will be granted on June 16th.
You will use your gmail credential to automatically access the system.
The system will ask you to provide your gmail password or give you automatic access if you are already logged in into gmail (through your browser).

We recommend that 1-2 days before the beginning of each class on the SMCE, you provide (once) your gmail userid by filling out the online form:

<div align="center">
<a href="https://forms.gle/JaCFNocQQP2WxYhL9">Provide your gmail userid HERE</a>
</div>

<p>
</p>

## <span style="color: red">Starting Point</span>

All the classes will be provided using Jupyter notebooks. We will be explaining the features of Jupyter notebooks as we move along.

Regardless of their level of proficiency in Python, all interns are expected to take the class on  **Introduction to Git**.
