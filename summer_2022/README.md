<a href="https://datascience.berkeley.edu/blog/python-data-science/">Python is a free, a general-purpose, and portable programming language. It is easy to use with its simple syntax and readability, which makes the code easy to understand and maintain.</a> 
Python can be extended via libraries that can be used to tackle problems in machine learning, data analysis, and beyond. It has a vast ecosystem and a dynamic user's community that make Python accessible to everyone.

The focus of this course will be on Data Science.
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Wikipedia</a>, **Data Science** is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science.
Because of its features, Python is one of the preferred programming languages that data scientists can use to explore and analyze their datasets.
The <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/">growth of Python in Data Science</a> has gone hand in hand with that of Pandas, External link  which opened the use of Python for data analysis to a broader audience by enabling it to deal with row-and-column datasets, import CSV files, and much more.

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of the Python programming language. In addition, it presents Python packages (Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas) used for data manipulation and visualization. The basics of Python combined with the Data Science topics, provide the necessary foundations for Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

The instructors are:

- Carlos Cruz (Carlos.A.Cruz@nasa.gov)
- Bruce Van Aartsen (Bruce.VanAartsen@nasa.gov)
- Jules Kouatchou (Jules.Kouatchou@nasa.gov)

## Objectives
In the Introduction to Python, you will learn:

- Python basic syntax, variables, and types
- Conditional statements and loops
- Data structures: list, tuple, dictionary, set
- Functions and modules
- I/O with text files
- Scripting and packaging

In the Python for Data Science, the following will be covered:

- Numpy arrays
- Basic visualization with Matplotlib
- Web scraping
- Data manipulation (reading data file, performing statistical analysis, visualization, handling time series data) with Pandas

At the end of the Beginners sessions, learners will be able to write a basic Python application using functions and modules.  
While those with some knowledge of Python when they start the intermediate sessionsâ€”Python for data science will be able to write their own Python scripts access web resources, read remote text files or tables, perform data wrangling, carry out basic data analytics and visualize data.


To take these beginner (Introduction) sessions and the more advanced (Data Science) sessions, you are expected to:

- Have a gmail account (needed to have access to Google Colaboratory). Everything will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
- Have a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>  account. Github is a web-based collaborative
  tool to discover, share and build software. You might need to share what you do with your mentor. 
- Install (**not required**) on your local machine the Anaconda Python Distribution. If your summer project involves writing a Python application, we  highly recommend you install Anaconda (please consult with your mentor)  by following the instructions at: [Anaconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- Install Git (not required) on your local machine by following the installation instructions: [Getting Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

**The first course will be on Thursday, June 9 and the remaining ones will take place on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays (from June 13 to June 27). All of them will be from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm (US EST).**

<p>
</p>
The classes on Monday, June 9 and  Friday, June 17  will take place on the [NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) Science Data Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE)](https://astg.mysmce.com). 
The access to SMCE will be granted on the days of the classes from 12:30 pm to 6:00 pm.
You will use your gmail credential to automatically access the system.
The system will ask you to provide your gmail password or give you automatic access if you are already logged in into gmail (through your browser).

We recommend that 1-2 days before the beginning of each class on the SMCE, you provide (once) your gmail userid by filling out the online form:

[Provide your gmail userid HERE](https://forms.gle/JaCFNocQQP2WxYhL9)

In the classes on the SMCE, we will use the `vi` file editor. If you are not familiar yet with `vi`, we recommend that you learn the basic `vi` commands.
You can start with the following tutorial: [Vi Text Editor!](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/vi.php).

## <span style="color: red">Introduction to Python</span>

If you have never been exposed to Python, you need to take this Introduction to Python course. In case you did some Python programming in the past and you want to assess your Python knowledge, take the following test (in less that 15 minutes and without using any help):

**<span style="color: red">Make sure that you take this placement test (only once) by June 11 before you are allowed to take any Python sessions.</span>** If you have any issue with the test, please contact Jules (Jules.Kouatchou@nasa.gov).

If you score at least 80% then only take the **Scripting and Packaging** topic. Otherwise, take all the Introduction to Python sessions.
